## :bulb: Utilização

- Start by cloning the project:

```bash
  $ git clone https://github.com/MvriloNascimento/Stage10-RocketMovies-Backend-.git
```

```

- Install dependencies:

```bash
  $ npm install
```

- Start a local server:

```bash
  $ npm run dev
```

- If everything goes well, you will receive a message similar to this:

```bash
  Server is running on port 3333.
```

- With this, all dependencies must be installed, and a local server will be running on port 3333.

- To use all the features of this API, we will use the following base URL:

  `http://localhost:3333`

- And to make the requests we will use Insomnia.
